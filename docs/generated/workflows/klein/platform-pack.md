# klein/platform-pack

**What's on this page**

- **Purpose, occupancy, and models** from the on-canvas Note
- **Graph flow** (groups when the canvas is large)
- **Every node id** on this graph
- **Node parameter reference** for each type, with this graph's values and the other legal choices

**What this enables**

- **Queuing this filename** with known widgets
- **Changing a parameter** with a documented generation effect

**Who this is for:** studio users who loaded `klein/platform-pack` from Apps or Workflows.

> Generated from `workflows/_lab/klein/platform-pack.json`. Do not hand-edit this file. Re-run `python3 docs/generate_workflow_docs.py` (or `make docs`).

## Purpose

Occupancy **klein**. Outputs under `${COMFY_OUTPUT_DIR}`. Unload the previous family before Queue.

```text
## klein/platform-pack

One identity, six platform plates (Klein 4B distilled, 4 steps, CFG 1.0, seed 42). Type any subject in PACK IDENTITY. Identity-mode enhance is **on** (camera-free bible). Each plate is independent T2I (own latent, no ReferenceLatent across aspect ratios). Hidden cards are framing only.

Prefixes and sizes (copy of the single-plate graphs):
- ez_pack_thumb 1280x720
- ez_pack_ig 1024x1024 (1:1)
- ez_pack_portrait 1024x1280 (Instagram 4:5)
- ez_pack_shorts 432x768 (9:16)
- ez_pack_og 1216x640
- ez_pack_banner 1536x512 (~3:1)

Unused SHOT groups may be bypassed (Ctrl+B). Occupancy: klein — stop Wan, LTX, podcast, music. One GB10 job.
Handoff: Spark Still → this pack → Silent 5s / Hook AV.
Prompt enhance is on by default (on-box Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507). After Queue, the Enhance node shows the prompt CLIP used (or a passthrough reason). Turn Enhance off to use the widget text as-is. Optional style dropdown.
```

## How to Queue

1. `./scripts/manage.sh start` so `_lab` is seeded
2. Load **klein/platform-pack** from **Apps** or **Workflows**
3. Read the on-canvas Note, change widgets, Queue

Do not edit raw `_lab` JSON. Save keepers under `_user/`.

## Node parameter reference

Every unique node type on this graph. Widgets are in lab JSON order. Choices are ComfyUI v0.34.6 / lab `INPUT_TYPES` — not SD1.5 folklore.

### `UNETLoader` — Load Diffusion Model

Load a standalone transformer/UNET from diffusion_models/.

!!! warning "Lab notes"

    Lab files: flux-2-klein-4b-fp8.safetensors, wan2.2_ti2v_5B_fp16.safetensors, ltx-2.5-22b-distilled-transformer-comfy-int8-convrot.safetensors. weight_dtype stays default.

| Socket | Dir | Type | What it carries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MODEL` | out | `MODEL` | Denoiser weights. |

#### `unet_name`

Type `STRING`.

Checkpoint filename under MODELS_DIR diffusion_models.

**How it affects generation:** Wrong family = Queue error or a melted picture. Do not swap Klein 9B / FLUX.2-dev / MiniMax.

**This graph:** `flux-2-klein-4b-fp8.safetensors`

#### `weight_dtype`

Type `COMBO`. Range / default: default.

Cast at load.

**How it affects generation:** default keeps the file's dtype (Klein FP8, LTX INT8-convrot, Wan FP16).

**This graph:** `default`

**Other choices**

| Choice | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `default` | Load weights as stored. Lab UNETLoader always uses this. |
| `fp8_e4m3fn` | Cast to FP8 e4m3fn. Can save memory; may shift Klein/LTX quality. |
| `fp8_e4m3fn_fast` | FP8 e4m3fn with fast optimizations. |
| `fp8_e5m2` | Cast to FP8 e5m2. |

### `CLIPLoader` — Load CLIP

Load a text encoder. The type combo must match the UNET family.

!!! warning "Lab notes"

    Lab types: flux2 (Qwen3-4B), wan (UMT5), ltxv (Gemma4-with-proj). Wrong type is a Queue error, not a bad prompt. MiniMax type is banned.

| Socket | Dir | Type | What it carries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CLIP` | out | `CLIP` | Text encoder for CLIPTextEncode / ACE / LTX. |

#### `clip_name`

Type `STRING`.

Filename under text_encoders.

**How it affects generation:** Must match the family (qwen_3_4b, umt5_xxl, gemma4-12b-with-proj).

**This graph:** `qwen_3_4b.safetensors`

#### `type`

Type `COMBO`.

CLIPType enum. Picks tokenizer + template.

**How it affects generation:** flux2 wraps Klein strings in a Qwen chat template — do not paste <|im_start|>. wan is UMT5. ltxv is Gemma4-with-proj.

**This graph:** `flux2`

**Other choices**

| Choice | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `flux2` | Klein 4B / Qwen3-4B text encoder. Lab stills. |
| `wan` | Wan 2.2 UMT5-XXL. Lab silent motion. |
| `ltxv` | LTX-2.5 Gemma4-with-proj. Lab AV. |
| `ace` | ACE-Step text encoder. Music graphs use CheckpointLoaderSimple instead. |
| `stable_diffusion` | SD1.x CLIP. Not a lab default. |
| `stable_cascade` | Stable Cascade CLIP. |
| `sd3` | SD3 CLIP stack. |
| `stable_audio` | Stable Audio T5. |
| `mochi` | Mochi T5. |
| `pixart` | PixArt. |
| `cosmos` | Cosmos T5. |
| `lumina2` | Lumina-2 Gemma. |

| `qwen_image` | Qwen-Image. |
| `hunyuan_image` | Hunyuan image. |
| `ovis` | Ovis. |
| `longcat_image` | LongCat image. Optional stub only. |
| `cogvideox` | CogVideoX T5. |
| `lens` | Lens. |
| `pixeldit` | PixelDit. |
| `ideogram4` | Ideogram. |
| `boogu` | Boogu. |
| `krea2` | Krea. |
| `joyimage` | JoyImage Qwen3-VL. |
| `mage` | Mage. |
| `minimax` | MiniMax. Banned in this studio (US Excluded Territory). Do not pick. |

#### `device`

Type `COMBO`. Range / default: default.

Where to load the encoder.

**How it affects generation:** default uses GPU. cpu is a debug escape hatch.

**This graph:** `default`

**Other choices**

| Choice | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `default` | Load on the Comfy compute device (GPU). Lab default. |
| `cpu` | Force CPU. Much slower; only for debugging a CLIP load. |

### `VAELoader` — Load VAE

Load the autoencoder that maps pixels ↔ latents (and LTX audio).

!!! warning "Lab notes"

    Do not mix families: flux2-vae, wan2.2_vae, ltx-2.5-video-vae-bf16, ltx-2.5-audio-vae-bf16.

| Socket | Dir | Type | What it carries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `VAE` | out | `VAE` | Encoder/decoder. |

#### `vae_name`

Type `STRING`.

Filename under vae/.

**How it affects generation:** Wrong VAE = color trash or a shape error.

**This graph:** `flux2-vae.safetensors`

### `EZKleinPromptEnhance` — Klein Prompt Enhance

Rewrite a lazy still/edit prompt for Klein 4B with on-box Qwen3-4B-Instruct.

!!! warning "Lab notes"

    Enhance on for lazy CLIP printers; off for authored recipes. Style ignored when it would fight an I2V start frame (not used here). Occupancy llm for the GGUF, then klein for the UNET.

| Socket | Dir | Type | What it carries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `prompt` | in | `STRING` | Optional override of the widget (usually unwired). |
| `context` | in | `STRING` | Bible/research. Ignored when Enhance is off. |
| `prompt` | out | `STRING` | String CLIP actually encodes. |

#### `sample`

Type `COMBO`. Range / default: custom.

Lab sample prompt or Custom.

**How it affects generation:** Custom keeps the textarea. Picking a sample fills and locks the Prompt. Python combo is the union of every catalog so Comfy accepts place recipes (Cliff villa on dream-house); JS still filters the App dropdown to this graph.

**This graph:** `custom`

#### `prompt`

Type `STRING`.

Lazy sentence or authored still prompt.

**How it affects generation:** When Enhance is on, the GGUF expands this into Klein-native sentences.

**This graph:** `A photoreal still of a tropical coastal city rooftop terrace at golden hour. An original techno wizard in an unmarked sun-washed teal technical running coat with faint circuit-thread seams stands mid…`

```text
A photoreal still of a tropical coastal city rooftop terrace at golden hour. An original techno wizard in an unmarked sun-washed teal technical running coat with faint circuit-thread seams stands mid-stride on the terrace. Warm gold-cyan holographic glyph rings bloom from a compact unmarked data-staff, empty of lettering.
```

#### `enhance`

Type `BOOLEAN`. Range / default: on for lazy printers.

Run the rewriter.

**How it affects generation:** Off = encode the widget as-is (plus style suffix if set).

**This graph:** `true`

#### `mode`

Type `COMBO`. Range / default: t2i / edit / identity.

System prompt flavor.

**How it affects generation:** t2i = new still. edit = change an existing still. identity = camera-free bible (identity-sheet).

**This graph:** `identity`

**Other choices**

| Choice | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `t2i` | New still. |
| `edit` | Klein-edit / clay / tweak. |
| `identity` | Camera-free identity bible. |

#### `duration_hint`

Type `STRING`.

Framing hint (YouTube 16:9 still, Instagram 4:5, …).

**How it affects generation:** Steers aspect language in the rewrite. Does not set the latent size — EmptyFlux2LatentImage does.

**This graph:** `platform pack still`

#### `style`

Type `COMBO`. Range / default: none.

Look reference woven into the CLIP prompt.

**How it affects generation:** none = off. Dropdown wins over style words already in the source. Hidden on I2V graphs.

**This graph:** `none`

**Other choices**

| Choice | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | Off. Do not weave a look reference into the CLIP prompt. |

**This graph:** `klein/platform-pack`

### `CLIPTextEncode` — CLIP Text Encode

Turn a prompt string into CONDITIONING for the sampler.

!!! warning "Lab notes"

    The dim CLIP box after Queue is this string. Prompt Enhance nodes rewrite it when Enhance is on.

| Socket | Dir | Type | What it carries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `clip` | in | `CLIP` | Matching family encoder. |
| `text` | in | `STRING` | Often wired from Prompt Enhance so the widget is a preview. |
| `CONDITIONING` | out | `CONDITIONING` | Positive or negative cond. |

#### `text`

Type `STRING`.

Prompt encoded by CLIP.

**How it affects generation:** Klein: sentences, subject → place → light → camera. Wan I2V: motion + one camera only. LTX: present-tense paragraph with audio interleaved. Distilled Klein quality lives here, not in CFG.

| Instance | Value |
| --- | --- |

### `Note` — Note

On-canvas operator note (not executed).

!!! warning "Lab notes"

    Every lab graph has one. Purpose, models, sampler, occupancy, run steps.

#### `text`

Type `STRING`.

Markdown-ish operator note.

**How it affects generation:** Does not affect pixels. Read it before Queue.

**This graph:** `## klein/platform-pack One identity, six platform plates (Klein 4B distilled, 4 steps, CFG 1.0, seed 42). Type any subject in PACK IDENTITY. Identity-mode enhance is **on** (camera-free bible). Each …`

```text
## klein/platform-pack

One identity, six platform plates (Klein 4B distilled, 4 steps, CFG 1.0, seed 42). Type any subject in PACK IDENTITY. Identity-mode enhance is **on** (camera-free bible). Each plate is independent T2I (own latent, no ReferenceLatent across aspect ratios). Hidden cards are framing only.

Prefixes and sizes (copy of the single-plate graphs):
- ez_pack_thumb 1280x720
- ez_pack_ig 1024x1024 (1:1)
- ez_pack_portrait 1024x1280 (Instagram 4:5)
- ez_pack_shorts 432x768 (9:16)
- ez_pack_og 1216x640
- ez_pack_banner 1536x512 (~3:1)

Unused SHOT groups may be bypassed (Ctrl+B). Occupancy: klein — stop Wan, LTX, podcast, music. One GB10 job.
Handoff: Spark Still → this pack → Silent 5s / Hook AV.
Prompt enhance is on by default (on-box Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507). After Queue, the Enhance node shows the prompt CLIP used (or a passthrough reason). Turn Enhance off to use the widget text as-is. Optional style dropdown.
```

### `EZPromptJoin` — Prompt Join

Join a shared identity paragraph with a shot-specific camera line.

| Socket | Dir | Type | What it carries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `identity` | in | `STRING` | World bible / character lock. |
| `prompt` | out | `STRING` | Joined prompt for CLIP / Enhance. |

#### `shot`

Type `STRING`.

Shot card (camera, room, action).

**How it affects generation:** lock=view front-loads this so Klein sees a new camera in the same place.

| Instance | Value |
| --- | --- |
| SHOT thumb | `Bold YouTube thumbnail still, 16:9. Subject large and readable. Clean of burned…` |
| SHOT ig | `Instagram 1:1 square. Subject centered, warm key, unmarked surfaces.` |
| SHOT portrait | `Instagram 4:5 portrait. Headroom for a caption, unmarked surfaces.` |
| SHOT shorts | `Vertical 9:16 Shorts still. Caption headroom at the top.` |
| SHOT og | `Blog / Open Graph hero ~1.9:1. Subject left-weighted, quiet right third.` |
| SHOT banner | `Ultra-wide channel banner ~3:1. Horizon low, empty sky band for a name overlay.` |

#### `inventory`

Type `STRING`.

Locked object list.

**How it affects generation:** Keeps mugs/coats from mutating across a pack.

#### `lock`

Type `COMBO`. Range / default: view.

What stays pinned.

**How it affects generation:** view = new camera, same place (dream-house, storyboard). state = same camera, new light/grade (time-of-day, color-moods).

**This graph (all 6 instances):** `view`

**Other choices**

| Choice | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `view` | New camera, same world. |
| `state` | Same framing, new light/grade/action. |

### `EmptyFlux2LatentImage` — Empty Flux.2 Latent

Allocate a Klein / Flux.2 still latent (width × height × batch).

!!! warning "Lab notes"

    Draft 768×432 batch 2. Hero / LTX feeders 1280×704. Portrait 1024×1280 or 768×1280. 1280×720 is OK for thumbnails, not for LTX feeders.

| Socket | Dir | Type | What it carries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LATENT` | out | `LATENT` | Noise canvas for KSampler. |

#### `width`

Type `INT`. Range / default: lab 768 / 1280 / 1024 / 432….

Latent pixel width.

**How it affects generation:** Sets the still's width. Match the intended platform (16:9, 9:16, 1:1, 4:5).

| Instance | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Size 1280x720 | `1280` |
| Size 1024x1024 | `1024` |
| Size 1024x1280 | `1024` |
| Size 432x768 | `432` |
| Size 1216x640 | `1216` |
| Size 1536x512 | `1536` |

#### `height`

Type `INT`.

Latent pixel height.

**How it affects generation:** 1280×704 is the LTX VAE grid (÷32). 1280×720 is not.

| Instance | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Size 1280x720 | `720` |
| Size 1024x1024 | `1024` |
| Size 1024x1280 | `1280` |
| Size 432x768 | `768` |
| Size 1216x640 | `640` |
| Size 1536x512 | `512` |

#### `batch_size`

Type `INT`. Range / default: draft 2; others 1.

How many stills in one Queue.

**How it affects generation:** Draft uses 2 for a cheap fork. Heroes stay 1.

**This graph (all 6 instances):** `1`

### `KSampler` — KSampler

Denoise a latent for N steps at a CFG, sampler, and scheduler.

!!! warning "Lab notes"

    Distilled Klein is CFG 1.0 / 4 steps / euler / simple. Raising CFG is not a quality knob. Wan 5B uses uni_pc and CFG 5. LTX distilled uses euler / simple / CFG 1.0 / 20 steps. ACE-Step uses 8 steps / CFG 1.0 / euler. TRELLIS uses 12 steps / CFG 7.5 / euler / normal.

| Socket | Dir | Type | What it carries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | in | `MODEL` | UNET / transformer after any ModelSampling* patch. |
| `positive` | in | `CONDITIONING` | What to include (CLIP / ACE / LTX prompt). |
| `negative` | in | `CONDITIONING` | What to avoid. Distilled Klein ignores this well — put constraints in the positive. |
| `latent_image` | in | `LATENT` | Noise canvas or encoded start image / video / audio latent. |
| `LATENT` | out | `LATENT` | Denoised latent for VAE decode. |

#### `seed`

Type `INT`. Range / default: 0 … 2^64-1; lab 42.

Random seed for the noise tensor.

**How it affects generation:** Same seed + same graph ≈ same picture or clip. Lab locks 42 on smokes so drafts are comparable.

**This graph (all 6 instances):** `42`

#### `control_after_generate`

Type `COMBO`. Range / default: fixed (lab).

What happens to seed after Queue.

**How it affects generation:** fixed keeps iteration honest while you change the prompt.

**This graph (all 6 instances):** `fixed`

**Other choices**

| Choice | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `fixed` | Keep this seed on the next Queue. Lab default for reproducible stills and 5 s prints. |
| `increment` | Add 1 after Queue. Use for a sequence of variations. |
| `decrement` | Subtract 1 after Queue. |
| `randomize` | Draw a new seed after Queue. Exploration only. |

#### `steps`

Type `INT`. Range / default: 1–10000; Klein distilled 4; LTX 20; Wan 20; ACE 8; TRELLIS 12.

Denoising iterations.

**How it affects generation:** More steps refine detail with diminishing returns. Distilled Klein is authored at 4 — raising steps is slower, not a quality knob. Do not raise LTX/Wan toward a 90 s denoise.

**This graph (all 6 instances):** `4`

#### `cfg`

Type `FLOAT`. Range / default: 0–100; Klein/LTX/ACE 1.0; Wan 5; TRELLIS 7.5.

Classifier-free guidance scale.

**How it affects generation:** Distilled Klein is CFG 1.0 — raising CFG is the wrong quality lever (use the Positive prompt, resolution, or still-hero). Wan silent 5B uses CFG 5. TRELLIS structure uses 7.5. At CFG 1.0 Comfy skips the negative pass.

**This graph (all 6 instances):** `1.0`

#### `sampler_name`

Type `COMBO`. Range / default: euler (most lab); uni_pc (Wan).

ODE / SDE algorithm that removes noise.

**How it affects generation:** euler is the lab still/AV/ACE default. uni_pc is the Wan 5B silent default. Ancestral/SDE samplers add extra randomness and weaken seed lock.

**This graph (all 6 instances):** `euler`

**Other choices**

| Choice | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `euler` | First-order ODE. Lab default for Klein, LTX, ACE, and most stills. Fast and stable at CFG 1.0. |
| `euler_cfg_pp` | Euler with CFG++. Rarely needed on distilled Klein (CFG is already 1.0). |
| `euler_ancestral` | Adds ancestral noise each step. More variation; weaker exact seed lock. |
| `euler_ancestral_cfg_pp` | Ancestral Euler with CFG++. |
| `heun` | Second-order Heun. Slower, sometimes smoother; not a lab default. |
| `heunpp2` | Higher-order Heun variant. |

| `dpm_adaptive` | Adaptive DPM. Step count is a hint, not a hard budget. |
| `dpmpp_2s_ancestral` | DPM++ 2S ancestral. Common SD1.5 pick; not a Klein default. |
| `dpmpp_2s_ancestral_cfg_pp` | DPM++ 2S ancestral with CFG++. |
| `dpmpp_sde` | DPM++ SDE. Stochastic, slower. |
| `dpmpp_sde_gpu` | DPM++ SDE on GPU noise. |
| `dpmpp_2m` | DPM++ 2M. Smooth; often used on SD-family, not distilled Klein. |
| `dpmpp_2m_cfg_pp` | DPM++ 2M with CFG++. |
| `dpmpp_2m_sde` | DPM++ 2M SDE. |
| `dpmpp_2m_sde_gpu` | DPM++ 2M SDE GPU noise. |

| `ipndm` | iPNDM multistep. |
| `ipndm_v` | iPNDM (v-prediction). |
| `deis` | DEIS multistep. |
| `res_multistep` | Res multistep. Some turbo recipes. |

| `sa_solver_pece` | SA-Solver PECE. |
| `ddim` | DDIM. Deterministic; not a lab default. |
| `uni_pc` | UniPC. Lab Wan 5B silent graphs use this with CFG 5. |
| `uni_pc_bh2` | UniPC BH2 variant. |

#### `scheduler`

Type `COMBO`. Range / default: simple (most lab); normal (TRELLIS).

How sigmas are spaced across steps.

**How it affects generation:** simple is even spacing and matches distilled Klein / LTX / ACE. normal is the TRELLIS pair. Do not copy karras from an SD1.5 recipe onto Klein.

**This graph (all 6 instances):** `simple`

**Other choices**

| Choice | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `simple` | Even sigma spacing. Lab default for Klein, Wan, LTX, and ACE. |
| `normal` | Linear timestep schedule. TRELLIS structure/texture stages use this. |
| `karras` | Karras sigmas. Often sharper on SD-family; not the lab default. |
| `exponential` | Exponential sigma decay. |
| `sgm_uniform` | SGM uniform. SD3-family default; Wan uses ModelSamplingSD3 shift instead. |
| `ddim_uniform` | Uniform DDIM schedule. |
| `beta` | Beta-distribution timesteps. |
| `linear_quadratic` | Linear then quadratic (Mochi-style). |
| `kl_optimal` | KL-optimal sigma curve. |

#### `denoise`

Type `FLOAT`. Range / default: 0–1; lab 1.0.

Fraction of the latent to replace with denoised signal.

**How it affects generation:** 1.0 is full generation (T2I / T2V / ACE). Values below 1 keep structure from an encoded start image (Klein edit / clay). Lab I2V uses dedicated latent nodes, not denoise<1 on empty noise.

**This graph (all 6 instances):** `1.0`

### `VAEDecode` — VAE Decode

Decode image/video latents to pixels.

| Socket | Dir | Type | What it carries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

No widgets. Sockets only.

### `SaveImage` — Save Image

Write PNG stills under the output folder.

| Socket | Dir | Type | What it carries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `images` | in | `IMAGE` | Decoded still or last-frame. |

#### `filename_prefix`

Type `STRING`.

Save prefix.

**How it affects generation:** Lab prefixes start with ez_. Last-frame savers on shot graphs feed concat-shots.

| Instance | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Save thumb | `ez_pack_thumb` |
| Save ig | `ez_pack_ig` |
| Save portrait | `ez_pack_portrait` |

### `EZNegativePromptEnhance` — Negative Prompt Enhance

Rewrite a negative CLIP seed so it does not fight the positive.

| Socket | Dir | Type | What it carries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `positive` | in | `STRING` | Positive CLIP string as context. |
| `prompt` | out | `STRING` | Negative string. |

#### `prompt`

Type `STRING`.

Negative seed (artifacts, not style).

**How it affects generation:** FLUX-family models do not use negatives well. Keep this short; put constraints in the positive.

**This graph:** `game-engine cutscene, Pixar rounded cartoon, illustration, muddy textures, melted geometry, duplicate limbs, watermarks, oversharpen halos, muddy blacks`

```text
game-engine cutscene, Pixar rounded cartoon, illustration, muddy textures, melted geometry, duplicate limbs, watermarks, oversharpen halos, muddy blacks
```

#### `enhance`

Type `BOOLEAN`.

Rewrite using the positive as context.

**How it affects generation:** Stops canned 'illustration / Pixar' terms from fighting a cartoon-positive.

**This graph:** `true`

#### `family`

Type `COMBO`.

Which negative family.

**How it affects generation:** Must match the UNET on the canvas.

**This graph:** `klein`

### `EZQuality` — Quality

Workflow-global Lab / Draft / High combo. JS overlays family-specific sampler and Klein UNET widgets.

!!! warning "Lab notes"

    Default lab leaves authored widgets. Draft is faster. High is slower. Distilled Klein High without Klein base keeps CFG 1.0. Never selects banned weights. Not --tier quality.

| Socket | Dir | Type | What it carries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `quality` | out | `STRING` | Selected quality id (lab, draft, high). |

#### `quality`

Type `COMBO`. Range / default: lab.

Lab default, Draft (faster), or High (slower).

**How it affects generation:** Family-specific overlays on steps, CFG, and Klein 4B UNET. Does not change size, length, CLIP, or VAE. Klein base High needs download-image --tier base.

**This graph:** `lab`

**Other choices**

| Choice | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `lab` | Authored lab widgets. Default. |
| `draft` | Faster: fewer steps. Klein stays CFG 1.0 distilled when already distilled. |
| `high` | Slower: more steps. Klein base 4B + CFG 3.5 when that UNET is on disk; else extra distilled steps at CFG 1.0. |
